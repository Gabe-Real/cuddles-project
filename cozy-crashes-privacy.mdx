3. Data Storage
User data is stored securely in a private file whilst pluralkit config is stored also in a file, but fully accessable to the public if they need help configuring settings. User data access is limited to the Bot Owner and authorized infrastructure.

4. Third Parties
Cozy Crashes does not share data with third parties, except:

As required by law

As needed for integrations with Minecraft APIs, which are done anonymously
